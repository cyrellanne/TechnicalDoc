		<p>JavaScript is a programming language commonly used in web development. It was originally developed by Netscape as a means to add dynamic and interactive elements to websites. While JavaScript is influenced by Java, the syntax is more similar to C and is based on ECMAScript, a scripting language developed by Sun Microsystems.</p>
		<p>JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, which means the source code is processed by the client's web browser rather than on the web server. This means JavaScript functions can run after a webpage has loaded without communicating with the server.</p>

		<p>Many users think that Java and java-script are similar languages, or they are two different names of the same language. But the user has to clear his doubt that java-script and java language are not similar languages, and java-script has nothing to do with the java programming language. The main reason for introducing the scripting language as JavaScript is the popularity of java programming language that was at its peak at that time. To get the advantage of the popularity of the term "java" in the java programming language, it was introduced as JavaScript.</p>
		<p>JavaScript is a lightweight programming language(“scripting language”) and used to make web pages interactive. It can insert dynamic text into HTML. JavaScript is also known as browser’s language. JavaScript(JS) is not similar or related to Java. Both the languages have a C like a syntax and are widely used in client-side and server-side Web applications, but there are few similarities only.</p>
		<p>Java is an object-oriented programming language and have virtual machine platform that allows you to create compiled programs that run on nearly every platform. Java promised, “Write Once, Run Anywhere”. </p>

			alert("Hello" + yourName);

		<p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
		<p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
		<p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>
		<code>const PI = 3.34;</code>
		<code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR
			function f() {};
			const f = 5;
			// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO
			function f() {
			const g = 5;
			var g;
			//statements
		}</code>

		<p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>
		<p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.</p>
		<code>if (true) {
			var x = 5;
		}
	console.log(x); // S</code>

		<p>Functions store intructions to reusable code.</p>
		<p>They are one of the fundamentals of software.</p>
		<code>function square(number) {
			return number * number;
		}</code>
		<code>return number * number;</code>
